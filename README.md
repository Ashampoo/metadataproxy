# Ashampoo Metadata Proxy Service

## Installation

**WiP**

Service to do metadata manipulation using HTTP methods.

The intended use is to allow metadata manipulation on big
files for self-hosted WebDAV.

This server needs fast access to the stored files.
So if you host a Nextcloud or Seafile docker container,
you would host this container in the same network.
